    "\n",

    "## 2. What Is Immutability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutability** means that once an object is created, its content **cannot be modified**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to change the value of an immutable object, Python **creates a new object** with the modified value instead of changing the existing object.\n",

    "a = 10\n",
    "a = a + 1\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",

    "The object `10` is not modified\n",
    "\n",
    "A new object `11` is created\n",
